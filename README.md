Developed a machine learning model to predict the probability of landslides in a given area based on various environmental and geological factors. The model incorporated data preprocessing, feature engineering, and multiple algorithm implementations to optimize prediction accuracy. Utilized Python and Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and visualization, and achieved significant results in identifying high-risk zones.
